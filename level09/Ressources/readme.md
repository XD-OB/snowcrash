## First check :
Home directory : \[âœ“\] not empty.
- ./level09
- token

## My home, my rules.

```
chmod 777 .
```

## Run it :

```
cat token
> *some unreadable characters*
```

```
./level09 token
> tpmhr
```

also ... 

```
./level09 aaaaaaaa
> abcdefgh
```

## Guess what ?

So we supposed that the content of the file was generated by the same program.
We created a C file that reverse the operation, and we redirected the file content to the new generated executable through a pipe.

> The C program :

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

void    main(void)
{
        char    str[100];
        int     i = -1;

        bzero(str, 100);
        scanf("%s", str);

        while (str[++i])
                printf("%c", str[i] - i);
        printf("\n");
}
```

We compile it and got the executable `a.out` .

```
cat token | ./a.out
```

aand ... 
## TADAAAAAAA, It's indeed the flag09 password !
