chmod 777 .

#files:
- ./level09
- token

#execute:
    ./level09 token
output: tpmhr

the token file contains an str with unreadable characters.

we also runned the executable with "aaaaaaaa" as an argument, we got "abcdefgh"
so we supposed that the content of the file was generated by the same program.
We created a C file that reverse the operation, and we redirected the file content to the 
new generated executable through a pipe.
cat token | ./a.out
we used the result as the password of flag09
